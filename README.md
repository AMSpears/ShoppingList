# Shopping List App

## Description:

This application allows you to create an account where you are able to create, save and manage many different lists.
This app is intended to make shopping easy and organized. Give it a try [Here](https://as-shopping-list.herokuapp.com/lists)

## Technology Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Ruby on Rails
- Active Record
- PostgreSQL

## Approach Taken:

Before developing this app, I created an ERD for my MVP and Silver goals. I also developed wireframes and
user stories to guide my process.
<!-- I'm tempted not to use terms like 'MVP' and 'Silver' incase someone reading your README doesn't know what those are. I'd focus on the planning and then the development process.   -->

## Installation Instructions:

Fork and/or clone the repository to render all the files.
<!-- How do i start the server and run my seeds? -->

## Future Implementations:

 - Give the user ability to add collaborators.
 - Give the user ability to share their lists.
